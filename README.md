### Adam Smith

<img align="left" src="./assets/adam.png" height="250"/> Adam is currently a first-year master's student in the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary.  Adam completed his undergraduate degree in mathematical physics from the University of Alberta in 2020, and gained an interest in GIS after designing a route planning app to accomplish some athletic goals.  His current research is focused on integrating quantum computing approaches into geomatics, and he is excited to apply his experience in physics to advance geospatial computing with quantum technology.  Apart from academic and professional pursuits, Adam spends as much time as possible in the mountains of western Canada, either mountain running and climbing in the summer, or nordic and alpine skiing in the winter. 

### Zonghao(Wade) Zhang

<img align="left" src="./assets/wade.jpg" height="250"/> I am a second-year Master of Science in Geomatics Engineering student at the University of Calgary. My undergraduate degree was completed in Geomatics from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in 2018, which offered me the opportunity to learn and understand Geomatics from traditional land surveying to advanced technologies, such as drone mapping. My current research applies the Agent-Based Model (ABM) in transportation. The multiagent spatiotemporal simulation of autonomous vehicle fleet operation is under development by using the City of Toronto as the use case. Outside of academics, I love reading Chinese poems and history, snowboarding in the resort and backcountry, hiking and archery. I also enjoy teaching snowboarding as a CASI snowboarding instructor.
