### Adam Smith

<img align="left" src="./assets/adam.png" height="230"/> Adam is currently a first-year master's student in the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary.  Adam completed his undergraduate degree in mathematical physics from the University of Alberta in 2020, and gained an interest in GIS after designing a route planning app to accomplish some athletic goals.  His current research is focused on integrating quantum computing approaches into geomatics, and he is excited to apply his experience in physics to advance geospatial computing with quantum technology.  Apart from academic and professional pursuits, Adam spends as much time as possible in the mountains of western Canada, either mountain running and climbing in the summer, or nordic and alpine skiing in the winter.
